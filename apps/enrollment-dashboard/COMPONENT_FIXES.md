# Enrollment Dashboard - Component Fixes

## Summary
Fixed inconsistent component sizing and styling issues in the enrollment dashboard intake form by replacing custom spacing overrides with standard shadcn/ui density variants.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Inconsistent Component Sizing
**Problem**: UI elements were rendering larger than default shadcn/ui implementations due to custom className overrides.

**Solution**: Replaced all custom spacing classes with the built-in `density` prop:
- Changed from: `className="gap-4 py-5"` and `className="pb-4"`
- Changed to: `density="compact"`

### 2. Components Fixed

#### intake-form.tsx
- Basic Information section Card
- Project Details section Card
- Guide Sections Configuration Card
- General Notes section Card

#### intake-overview.tsx
- Basic Information Card
- Guide Information Card
- Complexity & Pages Required Card
- Additional Information Card

#### intake-sections.tsx
- Section Cards with conditional border colors

#### intake-uploads.tsx
- Files & Uploads Card

## Implementation Details

### Before (Custom Overrides):
```tsx
<Card className="gap-4 py-5">
  <CardHeader className="pb-4">
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className="space-y-3">
    {/* content */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### After (Standard Density Variants):
```tsx
<Card density="compact">
  <CardHeader density="compact">
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent density="compact">
    {/* content */}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All components now use the standard shadcn/ui design system
2. **Maintainability**: No custom spacing overrides to track
3. **Predictability**: Components render with expected sizing across the app
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to switch between density modes (auto, compact, comfortable, dense)

## Verification

All components have been tested and verified to:
- Import correctly from `@repo/ui`
- Use standard shadcn/ui implementations
- Maintain proper spacing without custom overrides
- Pass linting checks
