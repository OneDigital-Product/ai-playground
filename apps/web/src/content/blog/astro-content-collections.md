Astro's Content Collections make it easy to organize and validate your content.

- Define a collection schema in `src/content/config.ts`
- Add markdown files in `src/content/blog`
- Query with `getCollection('blog')` and render with `<Content />`

It's fast, type-safe, and perfect for blogs like this one.
