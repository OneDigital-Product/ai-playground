     1. Install NeverThrow Dependencies

     - Add neverthrow package to the evps app
     - Add eslint-plugin-neverthrow for enforcing proper Result consumption
     - Update ESLint configuration to include the NeverThrow plugin

     2. Create Hybrid Error Handling Architecture

     - Client-side layer: Wrap all Convex calls with ResultAsync.fromPromise()
     - Shared error types: Create common error types that work across client/server boundary
     - Backend utilities: Use NeverThrow internally for business logic, convert to throws at Convex boundaries

     3. Implementation Strategy

     Client-side (evps app):
     - src/lib/convex-client.ts - Wrapper functions for all Convex operations returning ResultAsync<T, E>
     - src/lib/errors.ts - Shared error types and utilities
     - src/lib/result-utils.ts - Helper functions for Result composition

     Backend integration:
     - packages/backend/convex/utils/result-helpers.ts - Utilities for using NeverThrow internally
     - Convert Result chains to throws before returning from Convex functions
     - Keep existing Convex error patterns for framework compatibility

     4. Example Usage Patterns

     - API calls: ResultAsync.fromPromise(convex.query(api.intakes.list, filters))
     - Form validation: Chains of Result validations before sending to Convex
     - Error recovery: Use orElse and unwrapOr for graceful fallbacks
     - Business logic: Internal chains using andThen and map, unwrapped at boundaries

     5. Migration Strategy

     - Start with new EVPS app using full NeverThrow patterns
     - Gradually add Result wrappers for existing Convex functions
     - Maintain backward compatibility with current error handling
     - Focus on client-side benefits while respecting Convex constraints

     This approach gives you all the benefits of NeverThrow's type-safe error handling while working harmoniously with Convex's existing patterns.
